# server-starter-code

This repository is the server (back-end) starter code for Final Project - Full-Stack CRUD Application.

**Prerequisites**
- Install PostgreSQL (Postgres) [[link](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)] - required to run the database
- Install Postman [[link](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)] - optional tool for API testing

### 1. Use the following process to ***import*** the Final Project server starter code repository to your GitHub account as the starter codebase
1.	Log on to GitHub
2.	Click on the + sign in the top right corner (next to the user icon)
3.	In the dropdown menu, select "Import repository"
4.	A new page will open
5.	In "Your old repository’s clone URL" field, enter: `https://github.com/johnnylaicode/server-starter-code`

7.	Click on the "Begin import" button to start the process
8.	After the process completed, your new "final-project-server" repository is created – as a completely independent codebase

## Common Errors You May Encounter
### Error: password authentication failed for user "postgres"
This error is related to the user password you set for your own local Postgres database. 
#### Solution:
In the `server-starter-code/database/utils/configDB.js` file, replace the `dBpwd` value with your password for Postgres database.

```
  const dbName = 'starter-server';
  const dbUser = 'postgres';
  const dbPwd = '<your password>';
```
